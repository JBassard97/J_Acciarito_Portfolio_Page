# Jonathan Acciarito's Portfolio Page
## Description
This repository contains the source code for my Coding Portfolio Page, and serves as a place to showcase my previous projects in an aesthetically pleasing fashion. My contact information is also conveniently linked in the footer!
## Features
The CSS file contains techniques and properties that were previously unknown to me! Through this page's creation, I took my first dive into using "grid" layout, forcing images to fill their containers, and had a blast using :hover effects!
## Usage
Hover over the links in the header to see them change!
Hovering over each product card also brings forth the image's opacity! Clicking on the links in the header will jump to the part of the page referenced, with the exception of "Resume," which I'm still working on having a copy TO link! For now it links to Google.com, which is also where I'd love to work. The contact links in the footer will also contain my information and will automatically invite you to open an app to contact me.
